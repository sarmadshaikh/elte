These are the solutions to the assignments given in subject Sensor Data Analytics for the course MSc Computer Science at ELTE, Budapest, Hungary

#### Tasks
1. Prewitt edge detector: gradient filter and nonmaxima-suppression (NMS)

   Input: Grayscale image
    
    Output is two images: 
    1. gradient magnitute;
    2. final result after NMS.
2. Thresholding algorithm by Otsu

    Input: Grayscale Image
    Output: thresholded image and obtained threshold value.
3. Detection of circular object by edge detection and Hough transform for circles

    Input: 
    1. image containing circular objects, e.g., cells;
    2. range of diameters. 
    
    Output: 
    1. accumulator image; 
    2. input image with objects detected in given range of diameters.
4. Motion tracking of feature points and dense optical flow
Input: 1. short video sequence; 2. maximum displacement. Output: 1. points tracked in the video
sequence; 2. optical flows of the sequence.
